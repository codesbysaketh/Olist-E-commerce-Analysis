# 🛒 Olist E-Commerce Data Analysis  

### 📌 Introduction  
This project explores the **Olist Brazilian E-Commerce dataset**, a comprehensive collection of real transaction records from an online marketplace. The dataset captures every step of the order lifecycle — from purchase, payment, and shipping to customer feedback.  

It contains information across multiple dimensions:  
- **Orders** 📝 – purchase timestamps, delivery performance  
- **Products** 📦 – categories, descriptions, attributes  
- **Sellers** 🏬 – marketplace vendor profiles  
- **Customers** 👥 – demographics and locations  
- **Payments & Reviews** 💳⭐ – payment methods, installment patterns, and customer satisfaction  

By analyzing these tables through SQL, we uncover insights into **sales trends, logistics efficiency, customer behavior, and market growth opportunities**.
